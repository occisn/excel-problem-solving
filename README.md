# excel-problem-solving

This hobby project uses Microsoft Excel (without VBA) to solve numeric puzzles as those proposed by Project Euler.

When possible, two solutions are presented:  
- one using Excel spreadsheet capabilities (use of rows and columns),  
- another using one-liners, taking advantage of array formulas.

Problems solved :

**Project Euler 001: Multiples of 3 and 5** (i) in the form of a spreadsheet, and (ii) as an one-liner with SEQUENCE, MAP+LAMBDA and SUM array formulas  

**Project Euler 002: Even Fibonacci numbers** in the form of a spreadsheet  

...  

**Project Euler 5: Smallest Multiple** as an one-liner with SEQUENCE and SCAN+LAMBDA array formulas

**Projet Euler 006: Sum Square Difference** (i) in the form of a spreadsheet, and (ii) as an one-liner with SEQUENCE, MAP+LAMBDA and SUM array formulas

Note : functions working on arrays: SEQUENCE, BITOR, SUM, MOD...
