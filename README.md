# excel-problem-solving

This hobby project uses Microsoft Excel (without VBA) to solve numeric puzzles as those proposed by Project Euler.

Solved problems are Project Euler 001, 002, ..., 006.

When possible, two solutions are presented:  
- one using Excel rows and columns,  
- another using one-liners, taking advantage of array formulas.

Functions on arrays:  
SEQUENCE(10)  
BITOR  
SUM  
MOD
